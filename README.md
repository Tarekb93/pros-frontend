## Problem
Finding the right worker for fixing/repair/maintenance your home problems ( Electrician, painter, general constructor, AC-technician, refrigerator-technician ...).
In the Arab community, you need to make a few phone calls to get the phone number for such a worker (sometimes its a bad worker).
Or through Facebook groups (especially students who is asking for such workers)

## Team and Project overview

### Work split
Tarek: Regular user journey
Bader: Admin user journey

### Tech stack
Frontend: React, react-router, Sass
Backend: ExpressJs, PostgreSQL


## limitations of the app
Code wise: The Project seen at hand is a proof on concept, still missing the complete backend logic but can be implemented in a short time
In Practice: the app is not short on functionality , the main pillars of the app is solid and ready to be refactored and scaled on its simple foundation 
The app is not an end to end solution that manages payments between customers and workers
This is an idea that could be implemented if we got investors :)

## Future features?
- End-to-end solution, payment management
- could be scaled to include further specialists
- Various tutorials implementations 
- Geo live map location support
